```

## Environment

The code is written in C++20, in the reinforcement learnign toolbox DynaPlex. We tested our project on a Windows 11 environment and on a Linux HPC.


## Structure

The submodule folder links to the branch "dynamic_vrp" in the DynaPlex code repository.


## To the make the code work

Ensure that you clone the repository with submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

For further information, we refer to the documentation of DynaPlex
